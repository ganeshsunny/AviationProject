SQL / HIVE / SPARK [BATCH]

Generate ER Specific sample data from https://mockaroo.com/
====================
*)Best pilots so far in terms of maintaining punctuality
*)Invest more on which platforms customers are booking tickets from so that they can promote more on that website
*)Top 5 customers who travel frequently in airasia so that they can provide offers to them
*)Show delayed flights with source and destination
*)Passengers who cancelled their flights  
*)Monthly sales based on different routes
*)No.of services run each month in different routes 
*)No.of tickets booked by different customer categories
*)Prices of different routes

Based on SampleData1.csv  
====================
^)Assume that Passenger Airbus cruises at say 750kmph..
^)On board sensors are giving humidity,temperature,altitude data,distance covered since takeoff
====================
*)Create a stateless batch to find distance covered in the duration
*)In a defined window,calculate the ETA deviation & display flight info from master data
*)based on a random combination of humidity,temperature & altitude,maintain stateful info about the weather patterns 
====================
^)Cruise Speed,Batch,Window should be customizable
^)Generate more data if required for runtime visualization
